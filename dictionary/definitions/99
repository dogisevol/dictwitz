The temple is built chiefly of coarse granite resembling sandstone, and appears as a vast mass of masonry surmounted by several towers, the great tower rising to a height of 192 feet. Under the main tower are placed the three idols. Great multitudes of pilgrims come from all quarters of India to pay their devotions at his shrine. On these occasions the idol is mounted on an enormous car—the car of Juggernaut—resting on massive wooden wheels, and drawn by the pilgrims. Formerly many of the people threw themselves under the wheels to be crushed to death, the victims believing that by this fate they would secure immediate conveyance to heaven.
