Chlorophyl grains occur in the green parts of all plants, and are rarely found in cells that are not exposed to the light. In some of the lower cryptogamic plants they occupy and color the whole protoplasmic mass; in others they form bands or stellate shapes; but ordinarily they appear as minute rounded granules embedded in the protoplasm. These granules are the essential agent in the process of assimilation in plants, decomposing carbonic acid and water under the action of sunlight, with the evolution of oxygen and the formation of starch or other carbon compounds. The chlorophyl pigment may be extracted from the granules by alcohol and other solvents, and appears when dry as a green resin-like powder. In solution it may be separated into two portions, one of a yellow color (xanthophyl), the other blue or greenish-blue (cyanophyl, or phyllocyanin). The change of color in leaves in autumn is due to the breaking up and various transformation of this pigment. In the etiolation or blanching of plants by exclusion of light the chlorophyl granules lose their color and finally become merged in the protoplasm, from which they are again developed by exposure to light and warmth.
