Over 200 species have been described, of which about 170 are now thought to be distinct. They are widely dispersed through the temperate zones, occur within the tropics on mouutains, and extend in a few cases into frigid and subalpine regions. They are lacking in Australia and New Zealand, and nearly so in Chili and in South Africa. Sixteen species occur in the United States; 5 are eastern, of which S. aspera is the most common, and S. palustris the most widely diffused. Several species, especially S. sylvatica of Europe, are known as hedgenettle, and several others as woundwort, particularly S. Germanica. For S. Betonica see betony, and for S. palustris see clown-heal. Several species are occasionally cultivated for ornament, as S. lanata, a woolly-leafed plant much used for edgings. S. affinis (S. tuberifera), an esculent recently introduced from Japan, cultivated in France under the name of crosnes, produces numerous small white tubers which may be eaten boiled or fried or prepared as a preserve. The tubers are said to decay rapidly if exposed to the air, and are kept in the ground or packed in sand; their taste is compared to that of the sweet potato, followed by a peculiar piquant flavor.","text":"A genus of plants, of the order Labiatæ, type of the tribe Stachydeæ.","score":0.0}]},
