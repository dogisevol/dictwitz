It was originally described and figured by French ornithologists as a roller, whence its earliest technical name, Coracias chinensis of Boddaert (1783), with the English synonym Chinese roller of Latham. These terms being overlooked, the bird was renamed Corvus speciosus by Shaw, and the genus Cissa (later spelled Kitta) was founded upon it by Boie in 1826, since which time it has mostly been called Cissa sinensis, sometimes C. speciosa. It is 15½ inches long, the wing 6, the tail 7 to 8½; the head is fully crested; the bill and feet are coral-red. The fresh-molted plumage in life is a lovely green, but has the peculiarity of soon changing to verdigris-blue, as it does also in stuffed specimens, particularly if exposed to the light. This green or blue is varied with a black fillet encircling the head, with white tips and black subterminal bars on the tail-feathers and inner quill-feathers, and with bright sanguine red on the wings, which easily fades to a dull reddish-brown. A variety of the sirgang found in Sumatra is called C. minor; other species of the same genus are the Ceylonese C. ornata and the Japanese C. thalassina.","partOfSpeech":"noun","text":"The so-called green jackdaw of Asia, Cissa sinensis.","score":0.0}]},
