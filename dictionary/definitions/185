These peculiarities, together with the speedy and complete obliteration of the maxillopremaxillary suture, have caused the median incisors alone to be so named, and have occasioned great uncertainty in the dental formulæ of the several genera of shrews. Determination of the position of the suture has shown, however, that several other pairs of teeth besides the specialized median upper pair are inserted iu the premaxillary, and are therefore incisors; that the foremost pair of maxillary teeth (technically canines) are never specialized, and always small, and that these are followed by one or two pairs of premolars, constantly succeeded by three pairs of true molars. The constancy in number of the under teeth (twelve, with some anomalous exceptions) is also remark-able, and the total variation is only from twenty-six to thirty-two among all the genera. The eight upper incisors of several genera are a number unique among placental mammals; and the soricident dentition is, on the whole, in proportion to the size of the animals, the most formidable known among mammals, of greater relative power than that of any carnivore.

They are aquatic herbs, sending up from slender rootstocks erect or floating smooth spongy stems, and alternate entire linear leaves. usually with a sheathing base, stiffiy ascending at a wide angle with the stem (whence they were formerly called reed-grass). The flowers form globular heads, the upper staminate, the lower pistillate, in fruit becoming spherical compact bur-like bodies composed of many sharp-pointed spongy nutlets (whence the popular name bur-reed). They are sometimes planted along the margin of water.
